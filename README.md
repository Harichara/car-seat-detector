# car-seat-detector

This android application was created to be paired with a device using a Particle device.

The device is able to detect when a child is located on a car seat, the temperature within the car, as well as the location of said child.

The application notifies the parent when the temperature within the car is too high for the child, or when the child is not located on the seat.
